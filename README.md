## Storyline

Cat Khanh faces the task of navigating the challenging traffic of Vietnam to fulfill his deliveries on time, in line with the policies of the “1xBest” delivery company that prioritize speed over employee safety. Players are thrown into the heart of the action, and must dodge oncoming traffic, pedestrians and other obstacles to ensure that each delivery reaches its destination within the set time limit. Your mission is to help Khanh master his navigation skills, and ensure that each delivery is successfully completed. Do you have what it takes to help him accomplish his job?

## Gameplay

In "Delivery Boy", players control Cat Khanh across a minimalized city block. The shop's location is fixed at each level, but the delivery locations are randomly generated. The objective is to dodge traffic while crossing roads to deliver the goods within a strict time frame. It's a test of reflexes, strategy, and a bit of luck.
